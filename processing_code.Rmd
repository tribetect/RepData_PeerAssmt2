This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r reading_code}
#storms <- read.csv("repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2")#, nrows = runObs)
#storms2 <- storms[c("REFNUM", "EVTYPE", "INJURIES", "FATALITIES", "PROPDMG", "CROPDMG")]
#saveRDS(storms2, "storms2.RDS")
```
```{r}
storms2 <- readRDS("storms2.RDS")
str(storms2)
```

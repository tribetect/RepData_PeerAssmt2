###Synopsis 
that describes and summarizes the data analysis

### Data Processing
that describes how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the cache = TRUE option for certain code chunks.
```{r processing_code}
storms <- read.csv("repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2", nrows = 100000)
storms2 <- storms[c("REFNUM", "EVTYPE")]

#classify EVTYPE into smaller EVGROUPS
library(dplyr)
storms3 <- mutate(storms2, EVGROUP = "Unclassified")
for(i in 1:nrow(storms3)) {
  
        EVENT_i <- tolower(storms3[i,2])

        #classify as MARINE
        if(grepl("hurricane", EVENT_i) | grepl("current", EVENT_i) | grepl("tide", EVENT_i) 
           | grepl("sea", EVENT_i) | grepl("marine", EVENT_i) |grepl("surf", EVENT_i) 
           | grepl("coast", EVENT_i) 
         ){
                storms3[i,3] = "MARINE" #set the EVGROUP column
           }
        
        #classify as WIND, if applicable
        if(grepl("nado", EVENT_i) | grepl("wind", EVENT_i) | grepl("turbulance", EVENT_i) 
           | grepl("funnel", EVENT_i) | grepl("storm", EVENT_i) |grepl("burst", EVENT_i) 
           | grepl("dust", EVENT_i) | grepl("spout", EVENT_i) |grepl("cloud", EVENT_i) 
         ){
                storms3[i,3] = "WIND" #set the EVGROUP column
           }
        

        
        } #end of FOR loop

table(storms3$EVGROUP)

```

### Q1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
```{r population_impact_analysis}
require(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(data = storms)
g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = REFNUM, y = (INJURIES + FATALITIES))) + xlab("Event Reference Number") + ylab("Fatalities and Injuries")

```

### Q2 Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
```{r economic_impact_analysis}

```


### TO DO: Section called "Results" where the main results are presented?

### TO DO: Ensure atMOST 3 figures: Figures may have multiple plots in them (i.e. panel plots), but there cannot be more than three figures total.
